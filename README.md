Aim of the Project

Using historical loan data, identify what kinds of customers/loan applications are high risk and low risk, so that the company can:
Approve loans to good (low‑risk) customers.
Flag, price higher, or reject loans to high‑risk customers.
Design better credit policies and risk strategies.
